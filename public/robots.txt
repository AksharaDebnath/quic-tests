Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because we have an upcoming application demo, but the Amplify team has shut down our pod. Would it be possible to deploy our application on Quark as a temporary solution for the demo, ideally by Wednesday?

This would allow us to deploy the models and ensure everything runs smoothly for the presentation.

Please let me know if this is feasible or if you have any suggestions on how we can proceed.

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
