# FinancialBERT Sentiment Analysis

FinancialBERT is a BERT-based model fine-tuned on financial texts for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. This README explains how the model processes input text and assigns sentiment labels.

# Understanding the model

## Tokenization

The input text is tokenized into subword tokens using a tokenizer compatible with BERT. Each token is then mapped to its corresponding token ID from the vocabulary.

## Embedding

The token IDs are converted into dense vectors (embeddings) using the embedding layer of the model. Positional embeddings are also added to incorporate the order of tokens.

## Contextual Encoding

The token embeddings are passed through multiple layers of the Transformer encoder. These layers capture contextual relationships between tokens, resulting in a sequence of contextualized embeddings.

## Classification Head

For sentiment analysis, a classification head (a fully connected neural network layer) is added to the BERT model. This head takes the [CLS] token's embedding from the final layer of the BERT model, which is considered to represent the entire input sequence.

## Logits Calculation

The classification head transforms the [CLS] token embedding into logits, raw scores for each sentiment class. If there are three sentiment classes (negative, neutral, positive), there will be three logits. For example, [1.2, 2.3, 4.5] where [negative, neutral, positive]

## Softmax Function

The logits are passed through a softmax function, which converts them into probabilities. The softmax function ensures that the probabilities sum up to 1. The formula for the softmax function for a given logit \( z_i \) is:

\[
P(y = i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
\]

where \( P(y = i) \) is the probability of the sentiment class \( i \).

For example, [1.2, 2.3, 4.5] became [3.32,9.97,90.02].

## Probability Assignment

The output of the softmax function is a probability distribution over the sentiment classes. Each class has an associated probability that indicates the model's confidence in that class being the correct sentiment.

## Prediction

The class with the highest probability is selected as the predicted sentiment label.

# Why Use FinancialBERT for Sentiment Analysis?

FinancialBERT offers several advantages for sentiment analysis in financial texts, making it a valuable tool for various applications:

### 1. Specialized for Financial Texts
FinancialBERT is fine-tuned on a large corpus of financial documents, such as news articles, earnings reports, and corporate filings. This specialization allows the model to understand the nuances and terminology unique to the financial domain, providing more accurate and relevant sentiment analysis compared to general-purpose models.

### 2. Improved Accuracy
By leveraging the BERT architecture, FinancialBERT benefits from state-of-the-art natural language understanding capabilities. BERT's bidirectional training enables the model to consider the context of a word from both directions, enhancing its ability to capture sentiment accurately.

### 3. Enhanced Contextual Understanding
FinancialBERT's training on financial texts ensures that it captures the specific context and relationships within financial documents. This contextual understanding is crucial for correctly interpreting sentiment in complex financial narratives, such as market analyses or earnings calls.

### 4. Versatility in Applications
FinancialBERT can be used for various financial NLP tasks beyond sentiment analysis, including:
- **Text Classification**: Categorizing financial documents into predefined categories.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying entities like company names, stock tickers, and monetary values.
- **Question Answering**: Providing answers to specific questions based on financial texts.

### 5. Fine-Tuning Capabilities
FinancialBERT can be further fine-tuned on specific datasets to adapt to particular use cases or domains within the financial sector. This flexibility allows organizations to customize the model for their unique requirements.

### 6. Support for Multiple Languages
With modifications and training on multilingual financial datasets, FinancialBERT can be adapted to support sentiment analysis in multiple languages, making it a versatile tool for global financial markets.

### 7. Integration with Existing Workflows
FinancialBERT can be easily integrated into existing NLP pipelines and systems using the Hugging Face Transformers library. This compatibility allows for seamless deployment and scalability in real-world applications.
